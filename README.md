# Parsagram
Swift tutorial for getting following relationships from Parse and display content in a detail view

### CocoaPods
This project use Parse.com with CocoaPods, and will (probably?) require you to install the pods specified in the PodFile.
This project can not be run as is, since there are no Parse Keys supplied. You need to set your own and create your Classes
so they correspond with the Classes used in the project (alternatively change the names in the project)
